# Flappy_ML5

Control the ship with gestures of your hand.
Made with the feature extraction method of ML5.js library trained with pictures of my hand (it should work with yours too).
PS: keep your hand close to the webcam and point the cam to the ceiling, the model is trained with a plain background.

Inspired by <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgA1d_E-jY"> this video </a> from Daniel Shiffman.

if you want to control the game with your own gestures, in the folder there's a file called trainer.
